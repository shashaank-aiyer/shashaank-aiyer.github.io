Hi! I'm Shashaank, a first year CS PhD student in the [Algorithms and Theory Group](https://www.cs.umd.edu/researcharea/algorithms-and-theory) at the University of Maryland at College Park, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Han Shao](https://sites.google.com/view/hanshao/home). My research interests broadly lie in machine learning theory, and I am currently thinking about problems surrounding the underlying theory of language generation. 

I completed my undergraduate studies at Cornell University, where I received a BS in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics. At Cornell, I had the wonderful opportunity to work with [Karthik Sridharan](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sridharan/) and [Eshan Chattopadhyay](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~eshan/) on problems relating to active learning and complexity theory, respectively. After graduating, I spent a year working as a software engineer at Capital One.

In my free time, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/150322762) and [cooking](https://www.instagram.com/shankcooks/?igsh=a3Z2cHRhZnRob3E1&utm_source=qr), among other stereotypical activities for people in their early 20s.
